Hey, I'm Mike Hewner. I am a assistant professor at
[Rose-Hulman](http://www.rose-hulman.edu/).

<a href='http://hewner.com/files/cv2.pdf'>My CV (updated December 2017) is available here.</a>  I also maintain a <a href='http://hewner.com/files/cv2-nonacademic.pdf'>non-academic resume</a>. 

# Research

I study CS Education.

I'm studying is how CS undergraduates think about the field of Computer Science, and whether problematic views of the CS field can cause educational problems.  You can see details, including published papers on [my research page](research).

# Teaching

I love teaching Computer Science and I try to do it as much as I can.  I often blog about class design and how things went in practice - see the details on [my teaching page](teaching).

# Programming

I used to be a professional programmer and I do enjoy working on coding projects in my spare time.  I've worked on video games, designed/build circuit boards and firmware, and played around with fractals and other cool stuff.  Videos and code on [my building stuff page](programming).
