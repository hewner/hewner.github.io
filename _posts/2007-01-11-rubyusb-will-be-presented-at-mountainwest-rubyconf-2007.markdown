Yay!  So it's not exactly the most huge conference in the world but it's something.  I'll be presenting RubyUSB at MountainWest RubyConf 2007.  Apparently I have the 11-12pm slot on Saturday March 17th.  The conference will be in Salt Lake City.

I'll post a link as soon as they have a full schedule posted someplace.
