So I just passed my qualifying exams.  These are a traditionally significant hurdle in the Ph.D. process.  The point of qualifying exams is to ensure you're familiar with your area's literature and can do research.  Every Ph.D. program is different but for me the quals consist of:



	
  1. A 8 hour written exam where you answer 4/7 essay questions, drawing on the quals reading list

	
  2. A 4 hour written exam where you answer a personal question, drawing on the quals reading list and ~20 selections you worked out with your advisor

	
  3. A 1.5 hour oral exam where you present your research to a committee of 4 faculty and respond to their questions



I just finished my oral and officially passed (the professors were actually less aggressive than I thought they would be...it wasn't too bad).  Yay!  Now time for some slacking...
