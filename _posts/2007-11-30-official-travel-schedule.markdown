Woo...in the next few weeks Buffalo's Fantastical Traveling Roadshow will going nationally and internationally, and perhaps coming to your town.  As you know, I love each and every one of you BuffaloBlog readers deeply and individually and I will be deeply saddened if I don't get the chance to see you over the break.

December 8th-15th Sweden
December 16th-31st Ransomville
January 1st-January 6th Seattle

Anyways, email me if you want to get together!
