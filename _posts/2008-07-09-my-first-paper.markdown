So I will be published for the first time in the proceedings of the ICER 2008 conference.  In all honesty, I am not particularly wild about this particular paper - now that I really understand some more about how qualitative research works I can think of plenty of ways this could be improved.  Ah well, one step at a time.





<blockquote>
**Abstract**  

Computing educators may hope that postsecondary courses both convey content and also give students a new perspective on computing. In the study described in this paper, a sample of students about to graduate with their postsecondary degrees wrote about their relationship with computing and what influenced that relationship.  Computing majors wrote expressively about the excitement and breadth of the discipline.  Other majors were positive about computing, but the essays indicate that postsecondary education (including introductory computer science courses) did not have a large effect on their attitudes about computing.
