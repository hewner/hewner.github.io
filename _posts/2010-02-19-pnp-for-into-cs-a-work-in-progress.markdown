So after finally figuring out a way to get things appropriately transcoded, I had videos of me using Prezi to talk about P/NP.

Overall, I'm not sure that the zoomable interface really worked for me.  What I wanted was for my discussion to be embedded in a concrete document you could take with you after the presentation was through.

I still think the idea of linking the presentation to the document is a good one.  Here is [the pdf that goes with the presentation](http://technofetish.net/buffaloblog/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/pnp-page3-copy1.pdf).


But trying to layout everything in a small space made the visuals very busy.  I don't like that.

Having this terse version of your presentation in your field of view also I think encouraged me to be be terse and formal.  As a result I feel like this presentation was a lot less fun, which is a particularly bad thing for this whole P/NP business.

When I have slides by contrast, many of them reference prepared jokes and force me to keep re-engaging the audience.  Things like jokes won't ever really be able to appear on the "one page" version of a talk.

But then again, things are always different on the other side of the podium.  Anyone else willing to watch a hour long talk to tell me what you think?
