Finally everything is filed away and there's nothing left to do.  I'm off to Sweden tomorrow afternoon.  Perhaps a few bazillion hours of enforced solitude on the plane will give me some time to update this blog for your amusement.  Then again, there should be a crate of scifi novels waiting on my front porch.  And what have you all done to amuse me lately?
