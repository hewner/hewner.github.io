So it looks like I'll be spending 6 weeks of my summer at Georgia's [Governor's Honors Program (GHP)](http://admin.doe.k12.ga.us/gadoe/blogs/ghpblog.nsf/DailyBlog).  Students get assigned to a major and minor and basically get 6 weeks of super-intense boarding school.  They _apply_ for this, and some don't make the cut.

I'm looking forward to GHP.  I'm looking forward to the chance to teach a completely different group of students.  This is kind of class teachers dream about - intelligent, motivated, naive enough to believe your lies.    The CS classes will be in the context of a mathematics curriculum which I suspect will present its own challenges.   I'm also looking forward to hanging out with a group of professors who would sacrifice 6 weeks of their summer to live on-site and get paid not much.  That I think will make for some awesome lunch discussions.

A third perk is the opportunity to teach "seminars".  These are short evening classes that basically can be about anything you can convince a few students to come by and hear about.  I'm hoping to use this to try out all the wacky neat-o technologies and techniques I never have an excuse to inflict on the students.  I'm already thinking of dusting off my Big O and P/NP lectures.  Why?  Because I am insane.  Maybe also one on [Kodu](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/projects/kodu/), a super easy game framework by Microsoft that may have little pedagogical purpose but there is something to be said for making a game in 5 minutes using only an xbox controller.  And perhaps something with microcontrollers...who knows?

What about you blog-reading people?  What fun thing would you just like to inflict on a bunch of high school students?  Group theory?  Celluar Automata?  I am all ears.

For you Seattle-ites: when I'm not tormenting the youth of Georgia, I plan to be in Ben's place once again living like a drifter.  A drifter with a unwavering, ninja-like focus on writing his proposal.  But this drifter would not mind grabbing a coffee or drink with any old friends who happen to be out in his direction.  I'll be there from early May to mid-June.
