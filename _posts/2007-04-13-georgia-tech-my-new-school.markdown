So NYU really put up one heck of a fight.  Manhattan is so cool and there are some ridicously smart people up here.  Especially neat were the Systems people: lakshmi@ jinyang@ and jchen@ really made me want buy a tiny aparment and just write peverse networking code every day forever.  Watch out for papers from these guys: they are too cool.  But I eventually decided that GT would be the place to go if I really wanted to become a great Computer Programming teacher.  Sigh.

So look for me up in Atlanta way, come September.
