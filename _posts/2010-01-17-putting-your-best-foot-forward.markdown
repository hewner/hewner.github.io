So I'm going to introduce myself to the class I am observing.

[![](http://technofetish.net/buffaloblog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Are-you-being-observed2-300x225.png)](http://technofetish.net/buffaloblog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/Are-you-being-observed2.png)

Did it make anybody chuckle?  Trying too hard?

Those who want the complete presentation (yes, with even more jokes) can see my [slides including notes](http://technofetish.net/buffaloblog/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/observer_intro1.pdf).
