Yes I know it seems like you just got rid of me.  But due to some coincidences, various agencies are paying for me to be in Portland the weekend before my spring break.  So I'm taking the opportunity to hang out in Seattle while school's out.  I will be in Seattle Sunday March 15-Thursday March 20th.
