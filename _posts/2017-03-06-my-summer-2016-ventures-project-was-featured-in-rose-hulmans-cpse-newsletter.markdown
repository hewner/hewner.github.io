So Rose-Hulman's [Center for the Practice & Scholarship of Education](https://www.rose-hulman.edu/about-us/human-resources/faculty-and-staff-development/CPSE/index.html) publishes a newsletter, and they happened to highlight my collaboration with Rose-Hulman Ventures in their Spring 2017 issue.  I really have a lot more to say about the results of this project (all of it good, for the most part) - I guess I should post a full reflection, eh?
