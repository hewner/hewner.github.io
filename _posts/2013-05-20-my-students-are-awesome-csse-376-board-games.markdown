So in my quality assurance course, I ask my students to form groups of 2-3 and build computerized versions of board games.  I selected board games in particular because I knew board game logic was both understandable AND tricky enough that it could generally benefit from robust unit testing (which was what I was mainly asking them to practice for this project).

I was very happy with what my students produced.  Every team worked well and reliably turned out code week after week - perhaps partly because they knew I was monitoring their github commits :) .  These games are really quite complex...if you look at these videos I think you'll see tons of detailed (and tricky to implement) logic.

And...lest you think I was slacking on the testing...each of these games has greater than 75% code coverage...not at all bad when you consider the complexity of the GUIs which are mostly untested.

Anyways, check out their stuff!
