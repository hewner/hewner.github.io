So this summer I worked at a video game company to try and get a feel for what skills are important in that field.  I figure every CS teacher might not have time to wander off to industry for a summer, so while I was there I did a study about what game developers look for in a new hire.  I interviewed some developers, managers and artists and then used that to build an online survey.

For the curious, here is [my paper](http://home.cc.gatech.edu/hewner/uploads/8/gamedev-attach.pdf) as it will be published in [SIGCSE 2010](http://sigcse.org/sigcse2010/).  There was nothing earthshaking here, although I was impressed about the extent to which the people I talked to emphasized that people skills were at least as critical as the technical side of things.

There is a big chart a few pages in that summarizes the results.
