So I had a very nice leisurely lecture prepared that talked about the stack, buffer overflow attacks, and C varargs functions.  We were going to do a few different activities and maybe even a live coding exercise which I've been wanting to try.  Then I get an email from my practicum professor saying he wants to cover the stack, C I/O, Buffer overflow attacks, varargs functions, and malloc all in one class session - less than a day before I'm scheduled to speak.  That's over 50 unplanned slides worth of material, jammed into a 90 minute session that already felt a bit disjointed.

I was not feeling the love at that moment.

But what the heck.  I figured this would be the sort of real world teaching experience I had been warned about.

Here's what I did:




  * Eliminated some of my more time-intensive exercises, or replaced them with quicker versions


  * Cut a variety of content that I felt was less important, and distributed it as handouts + an instruction to read the book


  * Created my "exploding kitten" exercise, designed to let me move through the malloc material slight faster.  Basically I labeled certain slides with numbered kittens, and as I moved through the students had to record what deadly malloc error each kitten referred to.  The idea here was that students would pay extra attention when they saw a kitten, and would know if they missed something so I could go back to it.



All this and I still had to end only 1/3 of the way through malloc.

 So looking over my video after the fact, I felt confident that I had completely screwed everything up.  But [when I tabulated my student feedback](http://spreadsheets.google.com/pub?key=trwIypBDYo5fPIYWcraXHxw&output=html    ), everything was pretty positive.  Most common negative feedback: too much material and too fast.  I can't say I disagree.

Here's [the handouts](http://www.technofetish.net/mike/handouts2.pdf), [the powerpoint for the first part](http://www.technifetish.net/mike/mike-stacks-io-stack-smash.ppt), [the powerpoint for the second part](http://www.technfetish.net/mike/Mike-Ch19.ppt).
