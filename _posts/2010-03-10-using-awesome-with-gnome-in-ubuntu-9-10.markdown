Awesome is my favorite window manager.  It just warms your heart to see it running there in the process list whenever you do a ps --wwaux.  And the fact that it is a very nice, flexible tiling window manager is just icing on the proverbial cake.

But it always annoyed me that it didn't integrate with gnome.  I like my drop down application list, complete with wireless control panels and shiny point-and-click applets.  Maybe it's a sign that I'm comfortable enough with my geek-cred that I can admit that.  Of course I set all that stuff to autohide so no one looking over my shoulder can can know that I have wimped out.  

Now I've figured out how to get it working properly.  The details are all here: http://awesome.naquadah.org/wiki/Quickly_Setting_up_Awesome_with_Gnome
