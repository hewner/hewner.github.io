As part of the Game AI class I'm, I built an AI for playing levels of Super Mario Brothers (using [this framework here](http://www.marioai.org/)...I didn't make the mario game itself).  This Mario AI trains on one specific Mario level somewhere between 1000 and 100000 times.  It may seem pretty cool, but imagine how cool you would be if you played the same level of Mario every day for 275 years.  I bet you'd learn a few tricks too.

If you want to see how I did it, [check out the document here](http://hewner.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/mario-ai.pdf).  But prepare to be disappointed: this algorithm is really super dumb, despite the fact that I used many unnecessary greek letters to describe it.
