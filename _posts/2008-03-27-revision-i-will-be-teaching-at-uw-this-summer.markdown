So just as soon as I got back to Atlanta UW contacted me about teaching a summer programming course for them.  In the end, I decided that the opportunity to work with the UW faculty was more useful to me than working at digipen...even though digipen did sound more fun.

I'll be teaching your totally run of the mill second semester programming course.  This thing is so standard it's almost scary: I think I might have even had one of these MPs while I was a student.

But this does not change the essential good news: in Seattle for the summer.

You may wonder - was the interview process any different than digipen.  Answer: apparently they have that same brain MRI machine, only it works over the phone.
