I got pointed to this post about [how to learn programming](http://www.norvig.com/21-days.html).  My favourite section was where he talked about programming languages:


<blockquote>
Learn at least a half dozen programming languages. Include one language that supports class abstractions (like Java or C++), one that supports functional abstraction (like Lisp or ML), one that supports syntactic abstraction (like Lisp), one that supports declarative specifications (like Prolog or C++ templates), one that supports coroutines (like Icon or Scheme), and one that supports parallelism (like Sisal).
</blockquote>


I've got some stuff to learn.

And by the way, I was referred to this by [this essay by Eric S. Raymond](http://catb.org/~esr/faqs/hacker-howto.html).  Which says a few neat things - but like most people I find that ESR just bugs the heck out of me half the time.
