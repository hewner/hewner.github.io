I had a great time at this year's ICER conference - met up with some old friends and talked with some new ones about all sorts of CS education stuff.  I also published a paper entitled _Undergraduate Conceptions of the Field of Computer Science_:



<blockquote>
Students come to CS from a variety of backgrounds and with a variety of preconceptions.  Some initially select CS with a very vague idea of the field they are majoring in.  In this paper, I describe CS undergraduates' view of the field of Computer Science.  The approach was qualitative and cognitive: I studied what students think CS is and how students reasoned about their courses and curriculum.  Through the use of grounded theory in 37 qualitative interviews with students and student advisors, I extracted three different conceptions about CS found in undergraduate CS majors using Grounded Theory.  Overall, students had reasonable views of CS at a high level but lacked specifics. Students had difficulty describing subfields of CS or anticipating the content of courses they selected.
