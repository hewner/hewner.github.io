![Chaff Release](http://www.airforce-technology.com/projects/horizon/images/horizon4.jpg)

The annoyance of proprietary formats.  I hacked the data files include with the HIDDescriptorTool too produce one big json file that I could use for usage/usage page mappings.

Incidently, this is your opportunity to discover all the bizarre stuff specified in the USB spec.  Did you know you can have a "Chaff Release" button?  That way, anytime you need to release some chaff, in any program, you can do it in a generic way.

I know what you're thinking: why don't I have a chaff release button on *my* keyboard?  Well I can show you how to make one.
