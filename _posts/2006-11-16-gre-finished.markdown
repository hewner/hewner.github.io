So I just finished my GRE a few hours ago.  This officially means an end to learning silly words from flashcards and doing practice exams - hopefully for my whole damn life.  In theory, it also means I should be able to get back to working on the RubyUSB and other projects, although I will be doing some more college-app specific work as well.

I'm happy with my scores in Quantative and Verbal (though I did better in Quantative - guess this means I haven't been reading enough fantasy novels lately).  Writing - who knows?  I'll find out in a few weeks.
