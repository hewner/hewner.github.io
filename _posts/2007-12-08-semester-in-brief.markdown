Ben has requested some more details of the result of my semester, and seeing as I'll be sleeping on his couch in not too long I feel I'd best not disappoint him.  But I'm downloading bioshock right this second - so don't expect too much.

3 main projects:





  * **Bluetooth Twiddler** - This was the one handed keyboard I designed the circuit board for.  In the end it more-or-less worked.  But the firmware was a little bit too funky for me to really actually consider using it as a real keyboard device.  Not for a lack of trying on my part - this project overall took an insane amount of time.

But hey, if anybody needs some custom built PCBs designed, I know how to do it now.  Just say the word.  If printing was a little less expensive everybody on the Buffalo Christmas list would be getting custom made boards this year.


  * **CS Autobiography Surveys** - Recruiting people to do my surveys proved problematical, even with the $10 Starbucks gift certificate enticement.  At once point I even considered dressing in a clown suit and standing on the quad with a bicycle horn.  In the end, posting flyers across campus (we have a _lot_ of cool buildings around here by the way - there's one material's engineering building that really looks like the engineering section of a Startreck style spaceship on the inside) plus begging people at various classes across campus got me most of the way there.  We've got 25 - we were hoping for 30 - but maybe I'll do a little more pushing at the beginning of next semester.

As to results, I haven't really done the sort of formal analysis to say anything even semi-official yet.  There are some interesting things, some obvious things.  We can chat about it when I visit if you're interested.


  * **Wearable Prototype for Girlscouts** - my most traditional class was CS7001 - Introduction to the Ph.D. program.  By "traditional" I mean forcing you to do a lot of work for no reason.  Mostly, this class helped me revive all the old Buffalo bullshitting skills that I had forgotten since industry.  The final project of this course was a six page (10pt single spaced) paper on your main research project.  I took a half-done study with no results that likely had about 1 page of interesting stuff that could be said about it, and in 6 hours I made 5 pages of pure smoke-and-mirrors happen.  I've got no concerns about my grade but I think if I actually read what I wrote I'll cry.

Maybe the only interesting part of this course was working on a mini-project with Barbra Ericson - she's part of the Broadening Participation in Computer Science initiative and does a lot of work with Girl Scouts.  These Girl Scouts get to live the life your 7 year old nerd self always dreamed of.  Mindstorms, Alice, crickets - every neato toy you can imagine.  And now a new one - I built a prototype led/microprocessor fabric swatch for them using conductive thread and the [Arduino Lilypad](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardLilyPad) stuff.  It's programmable using scratch (and the use of some truly ugly Buffalo hacking).

So yes, even more hardware hacking.  I'm a regular EE major these days.  But no more - next semester it's AI and learning sciences.  I'm not touching a soldering iron.



Woo.  Ok, that's the breakdown.  Maybe I'll post more.  Or maybe I'll kill more technological zombies.  We'll see.

_Oh BTW, if anybody has any good ideas of a place I could keep my cat while I'm visiting Seattle, let me know._
