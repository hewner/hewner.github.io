So I was digging through my archives as I revamp the venerable buffaloblog to serve as my main homepage.  I found a video we had to produce as part of the 2007 Ubiquitous Computing course where my group designed a bluetooth keyboard device.  And it is _so bad_.

I've heard that Thad shows this video (or perhaps a later, slightly revised version of it) to current students as an example of a good project.  Scary.
